Files in jdk.internal.clang.libclang package are jextract generated and then modified.
jextract was run using "sh extract.sh" on Mac OS.

Manual modifications:

* GNU/CP copyright header added
* CSupport.SysV.* imports replaced by CSupport.* (platform independent C layouts)
* Generated C_LONG layouts are replaced with C_LONGLONG for portability
* Index_h$constants$N classes were renamed to be Index_h$constants_N
* Index_h$constants_0.libName was manually added to handle platform dependency of
libclang shared library.
