/**
 * A symbol lookup can be used to look up a symbol in one or more loaded libraries. A symbol lookup allows for searching
 * symbols by name, see {@link SymbolLookup#lookup(String)}. A library symbol is modelled as a zero-length {@linkplain MemorySegment memory segment};
 * it can be used directly to create a {@linkplain CLinker#downcallHandle(Addressable, FunctionDescriptor) downcall method handle},
 * or it can be {@linkplain MemorySegment#ofAddress(MemoryAddress, long, MemorySession) resized} accordingly, if it models
 * a <em>global variable</em> that needs to be dereferenced.
 * <p>
 * Clients can obtain a {@linkplain #loaderLookup() loader lookup},
 * which can be used to search symbols in libraries loaded by the current classloader (e.g. using {@link System#load(String)},
 * or {@link System#loadLibrary(String)}).
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, clients can search symbols in the standard C library using a {@linkplain SymbolLookup#systemLookup() system lookup},
 * which conveniently implements this interface. The set of symbols available in the system lookup is unspecified,
 * as it depends on the platform and on the operating system.
 * <p>
 * Finally, clients can load a library and obtain a {@linkplain #libraryLookup(Path, MemorySession) library lookup} which can be used
 * to search symbols in that library. A library lookup is associated with a {@linkplain  MemorySession memory session},
 * and the library it refers to is unloaded when the session is {@linkplain MemorySession#close() closed}.
 * <p> Unless otherwise specified, passing a {@code null} argument, or an array argument containing one or more {@code null}
 * elements to a method in this class causes a {@link NullPointerException NullPointerException} to be thrown. </p>
