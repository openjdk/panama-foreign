/**
 * A C linker implements the C Application Binary Interface (ABI) calling conventions.
 * Instances of this interface can be used to link foreign functions in native libraries that
 * follow the JVM's target platform C ABI. A C linker provides two main capabilities: first, it allows Java code
 * to <em>link</em> foreign functions into a so called <em>downcall method handle</em>; secondly, it allows
 * native code to call Java method handles via the generation of <em>upcall stubs</em>.
 * <p>
 * On unsupported platforms this class will fail to initialize with an {@link ExceptionInInitializerError}.
 * <p>
 * Unless otherwise specified, passing a {@code null} argument, or an array argument containing one or more {@code null}
 * elements to a method in this class causes a {@link NullPointerException NullPointerException} to be thrown. </p>
 *
 * <h2><a id = "downcall-method-handles">Downcall method handles</a></h2>
 * <p>
 * {@linkplain #downcallHandle(FunctionDescriptor) Linking a foreign function} is a process which requires a function descriptor,
 * a set of memory layouts which, together, specify the signature of the foreign function to be linked, and returns,
 * when complete, a downcall method handle, that is, a method handle that can be used to invoke the target native function.
 * The Java {@linkplain java.lang.invoke.MethodType method type} associated with the returned method handle is
 * {@linkplain #downcallType(FunctionDescriptor) derived} from the argument and return layouts in the function descriptor.
 * More specifically, given each layout {@code L} in the function descriptor, a corresponding carrier {@code C} is inferred,
 * as described below:
 * <ul>
 * <li>if {@code L} is a {@link ValueLayout} with carrier {@code E} then there are two cases:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>if {@code L} occurs in a parameter position and {@code E} is {@code MemoryAddress.class},
 *         then {@code C = Addressable.class};</li>
 *         <li>otherwise, {@code C = E};
 *     </ul></li>
 * <li>or, if {@code L} is a {@link GroupLayout}, then {@code C} is set to {@code MemorySegment.class}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The downcall method handle type, derived as above, might be decorated by additional leading parameters,
 * in the given order if both are present:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the downcall method handle is created {@linkplain #downcallHandle(FunctionDescriptor) without specifying a native symbol},
 * the downcall method handle type features a leading parameter of type {@link NativeSymbol}, from which the
 * address of the target native function can be derived.</li>
 * <li>If the function descriptor's return layout is a group layout, the resulting downcall method handle accepts
 * an additional leading parameter of type {@link SegmentAllocator}, which is used by the linker runtime to allocate the
 * memory region associated with the struct returned by the downcall method handle.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>Variadic functions, declared in C either with a trailing ellipses ({@code ...}) at the end of the formal parameter
 * list or with an empty formal parameter list, are not supported directly. However, it is possible to link a native
 * variadic function by using a {@linkplain FunctionDescriptor#asVariadic(MemoryLayout...) <em>variadic</em>} function descriptor,
 * in which the specialized signature of a given variable arity callsite is described in full. Alternatively,
 * if the foreign library allows it, clients might also be able to interact with variable arity methods
 * by passing a trailing parameter of type {@link VaList}.
 *
 * <h2><a id = "upcall-stubs">Upcall stubs</a></h2>
 *
 * {@linkplain #upcallStub(MethodHandle, FunctionDescriptor, MemorySession) Creating an upcall stub} requires a method
 * handle and a function descriptor; in this case, the set of memory layouts in the function descriptor
 * specify the signature of the function pointer associated with the upcall stub.
 * <p>
 * The type of the provided method handle has to match the Java {@linkplain java.lang.invoke.MethodType method type}
 * associated with the upcall stub, which is derived from the argument and return layouts in the function descriptor.
 * More specifically, given each layout {@code L} in the function descriptor, a corresponding carrier {@code C} is inferred, as described below:
 * <ul>
 * <li>if {@code L} is a {@link ValueLayout} with carrier {@code E} then there are two cases:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>if {@code L} occurs in a return position and {@code E} is {@code MemoryAddress.class},
 *         then {@code C = Addressable.class};</li>
 *         <li>otherwise, {@code C = E};
 *     </ul></li>
 * <li>or, if {@code L} is a {@link GroupLayout}, then {@code C} is set to {@code MemorySegment.class}</li>
 * </ul>
 * Upcall stubs are modelled by instances of type {@link NativeSymbol}; upcall stubs can be passed by reference to other
 * downcall method handles (as {@link NativeSymbol} implements the {@link Addressable} interface) and,
 * when no longer required, they can be {@link MemorySession#close() released}, via their associated {@linkplain MemorySession session}.
 *
 * <h2>Symbol lookup</h2>
 * Clients can {@linkplain #lookup(String) look up} symbols in the standard libraries associated with this linker.
 * The set of symbols available for lookup is unspecified, as it depends on the platform and on the operating system.
 *
 * <h2>Safety considerations</h2>
 *
 * Obtaining downcall method handle is intrinsically unsafe. A symbol in a native library does not, in general,
 * contain enough signature information (e.g. arity and types of native function parameters). As a consequence,
 * the linker runtime cannot validate linkage requests. When a client interacts with a downcall method handle obtained
 * through an invalid linkage request (e.g. by specifying a function descriptor featuring too many argument layouts),
 * the result of such interaction is unspecified and can lead to JVM crashes. On downcall handle invocation,
 * the linker runtime guarantees the following for any argument that is a memory resource {@code R} (of type {@link MemorySegment},
 * {@link NativeSymbol} or {@link VaList}):
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The memory session of {@code R} is {@linkplain MemorySession#isAlive() alive}. Otherwise, the invocation throws
 *     {@link IllegalStateException};</li>
 *     <li>The invocation occurs in same thread as the one {@link MemorySession#ownerThread() owning} the memory session of {@code R},
 *     if said session is confined. Otherwise, the invocation throws {@link IllegalStateException}; and</li>
 *     <li>The memory session of {@code R} is {@linkplain MemorySession#whileAlive(Runnable) kept alive} (and cannot be closed) during the invocation.
 *</ul>
 * <p>
 * When creating upcall stubs the linker runtime validates the type of the target method handle against the provided
 * function descriptor and report an error if any mismatch is detected. As for downcalls, JVM crashes might occur,
 * if the native code casts the function pointer associated with an upcall stub to a type
 * that is incompatible with the provided function descriptor. Moreover, if the target method
 * handle associated with an upcall stub returns a {@linkplain MemoryAddress native address}, clients must ensure
 * that this address cannot become invalid after the upcall completes. This can lead to unspecified behavior,
 * and even JVM crashes, since an upcall is typically executed in the context of a downcall method handle invocation.
 *

 * Implementations of this interface are immutable, thread-safe and <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>.
