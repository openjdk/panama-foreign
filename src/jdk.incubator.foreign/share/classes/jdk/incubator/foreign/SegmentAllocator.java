/**
 * This interface models a memory allocator. Clients implementing this interface
 * must implement the {@link #allocate(long, long)} method. This interface defines several default methods
 * which can be useful to create segments from several kinds of Java values such as primitives and arrays.
 * This interface can be seen as a thin wrapper around the basic capabilities for creating native segments
 * (e.g. {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long, long, ResourceScope)}); since {@link SegmentAllocator} is a <em>functional interface</em>,
 * clients can easily obtain a native allocator by using either a lambda expression or a method reference.
 * <p>
 * This interface also defines factories for commonly used allocators; for instance {@link #arenaUnbounded(ResourceScope)}
 * and {@link #arenaBounded(long, ResourceScope)} are arena-style native allocators. Finally {@link #prefixAllocator(MemorySegment)}
 * returns an allocator which wraps a segment (either on-heap or off-heap) and recycles its content upon each new allocation request.
