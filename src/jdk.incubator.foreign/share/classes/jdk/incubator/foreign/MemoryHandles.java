/**
 * This class defines several factory methods for constructing and combining memory access var handles.
 * To obtain a memory access var handle, clients must start from one of the <em>leaf</em> methods
 * (see {@link MemoryHandles#varHandle(Class, ByteOrder)},
 * {@link MemoryHandles#varHandle(Class, long, ByteOrder)}). This determines the variable type
 * (all primitive types but {@code void} and {@code boolean} are supported, along with {@code MemoryAddress}), as well as the alignment constraint and the
 * byte order associated to a memory access var handle. The resulting memory access var handle can then be combined in various ways
 * to emulate different addressing modes. The var handles created by this class feature a <em>mandatory</em> coordinate type
 * (of type {@link MemoryAddress}), and zero or more {@code long} coordinate types, which can be used to emulate
 * multi-dimensional array indexing.
 * <p>
 * As an example, consider the memory layout expressed by a {@link SequenceLayout} instance constructed as follows:
 * <blockquote><pre>{@code
SequenceLayout seq = MemoryLayout.ofSequence(5,
    MemoryLayout.ofStruct(
        MemoryLayout.ofPaddingBits(32),
        MemoryLayout.ofValueBits(32, ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN).withName("value")
    ));
 * }</pre></blockquote>
 * To access the member layout named {@code value}, we can construct a memory access var handle as follows:
 * <blockquote><pre>{@code
VarHandle handle = MemoryHandles.varHandle(int.class, ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN); //(MemoryAddress) -> int
handle = MemoryHandles.withOffset(handle, 4); //(MemoryAddress) -> int
handle = MemoryHandles.withStride(handle, 8); //(MemoryAddress, long) -> int
 * }</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <h2>Addressing mode</h2>
 *
 * The final memory location accessed by a memory access var handle can be computed as follows:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>{@code
address = base + offset
 * }</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * where {@code base} denotes the address expressed by the {@link MemoryAddress} access coordinate, and {@code offset}
 * can be expressed in the following form:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>{@code
offset = c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_m + (x_1 * s_1) + (x_2 * s_2) + ... + (x_n * s_n)
 * }</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * where {@code x_1}, {@code x_2}, ... {@code x_n} are <em>dynamic</em> values provided as optional {@code long}
 * access coordinates, whereas {@code c_1}, {@code c_2}, ... {@code c_m} and {@code s_0}, {@code s_1}, ... {@code s_n} are
 * <em>static</em> constants which are can be acquired through the {@link MemoryHandles#withOffset(VarHandle, long)}
 * and the {@link MemoryHandles#withStride(VarHandle, long)} combinators, respectively.
 *
 * <h2><a id="memaccess-mode"></a>Alignment and access modes</h2>
 *
 * A memory access var handle is associated with an access size {@code S} and an alignment constraint {@code B}
 * (both expressed in bytes). We say that a memory access operation is <em>fully aligned</em> if it occurs
 * at a memory address {@code A} which is compatible with both alignment constraints {@code S} and {@code B}.
 * If access is fully aligned then following access modes are supported and are
 * guaranteed to support atomic access:
 * <ul>
 * <li>read write access modes for all {@code T}, with the exception of
 *     access modes {@code get} and {@code set} for {@code long} and
 *     {@code double} on 32-bit platforms.
 * <li>atomic update access modes for {@code int}, {@code long},
 *     {@code float} or {@code double}.
 *     (Future major platform releases of the JDK may support additional
 *     types for certain currently unsupported access modes.)
 * <li>numeric atomic update access modes for {@code int} and {@code long}.
 *     (Future major platform releases of the JDK may support additional
 *     numeric types for certain currently unsupported access modes.)
 * <li>bitwise atomic update access modes for {@code int} and {@code long}.
 *     (Future major platform releases of the JDK may support additional
 *     numeric types for certain currently unsupported access modes.)
 * </ul>
 *
 * If {@code T} is {@code float} or {@code double} then atomic
 * update access modes compare values using their bitwise representation
 * (see {@link Float#floatToRawIntBits} and
 * {@link Double#doubleToRawLongBits}, respectively).
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, a memory access operation is <em>partially aligned</em> if it occurs at a memory address {@code A}
 * which is only compatible with the alignment constraint {@code B}; in such cases, access for anything other than the
 * {@code get} and {@code set} access modes will result in an {@code IllegalStateException}. If access is partially aligned,
 * atomic access is only guaranteed with respect to the largest power of two that divides the GCD of {@code A} and {@code S}.
 * <p>
 * Finally, in all other cases, we say that a memory access operation is <em>misaligned</em>; in such cases an
 * {@code IllegalStateException} is thrown, irrespective of the access mode being used.
