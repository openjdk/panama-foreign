/**
 * A memory segment models a contiguous region of memory. A memory segment is associated with both spatial
 * and temporal bounds. Spatial bounds ensure that memory access operations on a memory segment cannot affect a memory location
 * which falls <em>outside</em> the boundaries of the memory segment being accessed. Temporal checks ensure that memory access
 * operations on a segment cannot occur after a memory segment has been closed (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}).
 * <p>
 * All implementations of this interface must be <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>;
 * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on
 * instances of {@code MemorySegment} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The {@code equals} method should
 * be used for comparisons.
 * <p>
 * Non-platform classes should not implement {@linkplain MemorySegment} directly.
 *
 * <h2>Constructing memory segments from different sources</h2>
 *
 * There are multiple ways to obtain a memory segment. First, memory segments backed by off-heap memory can
 * be allocated using one of the many factory methods provided (see {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(MemoryLayout)},
 * {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long)} and {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long, long)}). Memory segments obtained
 * in this way are called <em>native memory segments</em>.
 * <p>
 * It is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing heap-allocated Java array,
 * using one of the provided factory methods (e.g. {@link MemorySegment#ofArray(int[])}). Memory segments obtained
 * in this way are called <em>array memory segments</em>.
 * <p>
 * It is possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing Java byte buffer (see {@link ByteBuffer}),
 * using the factory method {@link MemorySegment#ofByteBuffer(ByteBuffer)}.
 * Memory segments obtained in this way are called <em>buffer memory segments</em>. Note that buffer memory segments might
 * be backed by native memory (as in the case of native memory segments) or heap memory (as in the case of array memory segments),
 * depending on the characteristics of the byte buffer instance the segment is associated with. For instance, a buffer memory
 * segment obtained from a byte buffer created with the {@link ByteBuffer#allocateDirect(int)} method will be backed
 * by native memory.
 * <p>
 * Finally, it is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by a memory-mapped file using the factory method
 * {@link MemorySegment#mapFromPath(Path, long, FileChannel.MapMode)}. Such memory segments are called <em>mapped memory segments</em>.
 *
 * <h2>Closing a memory segment</h2>
 *
 * Memory segments are closed explicitly (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}). In general when a segment is closed, all off-heap
 * resources associated with it are released; this has different meanings depending on the kind of memory segment being
 * considered:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>closing a native memory segment results in <em>freeing</em> the native memory associated with it</li>
 *     <li>closing a mapped memory segment results in the backing memory-mapped file to be unmapped</li>
 *     <li>closing an acquired memory segment <b>does not</b> result in the release of resources
 *     (see the section on <a href="#thread-confinement">thread confinement</a> for more details)</li>
 *     <li>closing a buffer, or a heap segment does not have any side-effect, other than marking the segment
 *     as <em>not alive</em> (see {@link MemorySegment#isAlive()}). Also, since the buffer and heap segments might keep
 *     strong references to the original buffer or array instance, it is the responsibility of clients to ensure that
 *     these segments are discarded in a timely manner, so as not to prevent garbage collection to reclaim the underlying
 *     objects.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2><a id = "thread-confinement">Thread confinement</a></h2>
 *
 * Memory segments support strong thread-confinement guarantees. Upon creation, they are assigned an <em>owner thread</em>,
 * typically the thread which initiated the creation operation. After creation, only the owner thread will be allowed
 * to directly manipulate the memory segment (e.g. close the memory segment) or access the underlying memory associated with
 * the segment using a memory access var handle. Any attempt to perform such operations from a thread other than the
 * owner thread will result in a runtime failure.
 * <p>
 * If a memory segment S owned by thread A needs to be used by thread B, B needs to explicitly <em>acquire</em> S,
 * which will create a so called <em>acquired</em> memory segment owned by B (see {@link #acquire()}) backed by the same resources
 * as S. A memory segment can be acquired multiple times by one or more threads; in that case, a memory segment S cannot
 * be closed until all the acquired memory segments derived from S have been closed. Furthermore, closing an acquired
 * memory segment does <em>not</em> trigger any deallocation action. It is therefore important that clients remember to
 * explicitly close the original segment from which the acquired memory segments have been obtained in order to truly
 * ensure that off-heap resources associated with the memory segment are released.
 *
 * <h2>Memory segment views</h2>
 *
 * Memory segments support <em>views</em>. It is possible to create an <em>immutable</em> view of a memory segment
 * (see {@link MemorySegment#asReadOnly()}) which does not support write operations. It is also possible to create views
 * whose spatial bounds are stricter than the ones of the original segment (see {@link MemorySegment#asSlice(long, long)}).
 * <p>
 * Temporal bounds of the original segment are inherited by the view; that is, closing a segment view, such as a sliced
 * view, will cause the original segment to be closed; as such special care must be taken when sharing views
 * between multiple clients. If a client want to protect itself against early closure of a segment by
 * another actor, it is the responsibility of that client to take protective measures, such as calling
 * {@link MemorySegment#acquire()} before sharing the view with another client.
 * <p>
 * To allow for interoperability with existing code, a byte buffer view can be obtained from a memory segment
 * (see {@link #asByteBuffer()}). This can be useful, for instance, for those clients that want to keep using the
 * {@link ByteBuffer} API, but need to operate on large memory segments. Byte buffers obtained in such a way support
 * the same spatial and temporal access restrictions associated to the memory address from which they originated.
 *
 * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemorySegment}
 * may become a {@code sealed} interface, which would prohibit subclassing except by
 * explicitly permitted types.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * Implementations of this interface are immutable and thread-safe.
