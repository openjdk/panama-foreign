/**
 * A native library lookup. Exposes lookup operation for searching symbols, see {@link LibraryLookup#lookup(String)}.
 * A given native library remains loaded as long as there is at least one <em>live</em> library lookup instance referring
 * to it.
 * <p>
 * Memory address instances generated by a library lookup will contain a strong reference to the originating lookup object,
 * therefore preventing library unloading; in turn method handle instances obtained from
 * {@link SystemABI#downcallHandle(MemoryAddress, MethodType, FunctionDescriptor)}) also maintain a strong reference
 * to the memory address parameter used for their construction. This means that there is always a strong reachability chain
 * from a native method handle to a lookup object (the one that was used to lookup the native library symbol the method handle
 * refers to); this is useful to prevent situations where a native library is unloaded in the middle of a native call.
 * <p>
 * To allow for a library to be unloaded, a client will have to discard any strong references it
 * maintains, directly, or indirectly to a lookup object associated with given library.
