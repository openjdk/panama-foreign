/**
 * This class manages the temporal bounds associated with a memory segment as well
 * as thread confinement. A scope has a liveness bit, which is updated when the scope is closed
 * (this operation is triggered by {@link AbstractMemorySegmentImpl#close()}). This bit is consulted prior
 * to memory access (see {@link #checkValidState()}).
 * There are two kinds of memory scope: confined memory scope and shared memory scope.
 * A confined memory scope has an associated owner thread that confines some operations to
 * associated owner thread such as {@link #close()} or {@link #checkValidState()}.
 * Shared scopes do not feature an owner thread - meaning their operations can be called, in a racy
 * manner, by multiple threads. To guarantee temporal safety in the presence of concurrent thread,
 * shared scopes use a more sophisticated synchronization mechanism, which guarantees that no concurrent
 * access is possible when a scope is being closed (see {@link jdk.internal.misc.ScopedMemoryAccess}.
